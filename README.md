## Smoke Detector Project

The **Smoke Detector Project** is built using an Arduino Uno board, an MQ-2 smoke sensor, a Bluetooth module, a 16x2 LCD display, LEDs, and a buzzer. This project is designed to detect smoke in the environment and alert the user via the LCD display, LEDs, and buzzer.

The system provides an affordable, user-friendly, and efficient solution for detecting and alerting smoke presence in enclosed spaces, showcasing how microcontrollers and sensors can create practical systems for real-world applications.

### Features

- **Real-time Display**: The LCD displays smoke levels in real-time.
- **Visual Alerts**: LEDs provide instant feedback when smoke levels exceed the threshold.
- **Audible Alarm**: The buzzer emits an alert sound when smoke levels reach a dangerous level.

Overall, this project delivers a simple and effective solution for detecting smoke and hazardous gases in real-time, with the added benefit of remote monitoring.
